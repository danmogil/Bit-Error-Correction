# Bit-Error Correction
[Bit errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction) occur when data-bits are undesirably flipped during transfer. Causes include: *network interference, hardware failure/deterioration, etc.* [Hamming codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code) are error-correcting codes capable of reversing single bit errors. Additionally, Hamming codes' efficiency grows exponentially as message length increases.
